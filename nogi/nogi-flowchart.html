					<h1 class="homepage section-description-header">Roll with the tide</h1>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">As a no-Gi BJJ practitioner, I find that this style of jiu-jitsu is heavily reliant on understanding the fundamentals of human movement and physiology. This is not to say that Gi-based BJJ does not require the same high level of understanding, I assure you that I does. I'm simply pointing out what is obvious, that no-Gi BJJ does away with the Gi, the historical and quintessential fixure of the martial art itself.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">I need to interpret and react to my opponents body movements in a entirely different way than with the Gi. The Gi was my suit of armor, my sword, and my shield. With all the friction, drag, and grips that the Gi provides, I could track and control my opponents movement to set-up attacks and defensive positions effectively. Without the Gi, I now have deal with an opponent that can move a lot less restricted than before, with less attacking/defending options at my disposal.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">There exists a vast number of ways to address the differences between the two branches of BJJ, here, I have selected the three components that I focus on to improve my no-Gi game.</p>

						<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Lacking Gi grips, I must use opponent's natural body handles to control their movement. My opponents neck, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles will provide these handles for me.</p>
						<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Significantly reduced friction makes no-Gi BJJ fast-paced. It is tough to slow down a slick, fast opponent. The faster tempo makes it tricky to set-up and execute a highly technical, multi-step maneuver.</p>

						<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Faster movement and reduced control reduces the time I have to think and chain complex movement patterns together.

					<h1 class="stand-up section-description-header">Stand-up Concepts</h1>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. I like to take my opponent down by tracking how they react and move to keep their stability when I try to unbalance them. Ultimately, I want to control and fill the inside of the pocket. I find it best to focus on limiting my time in the clinch, vary my movement speed, and control the amount of space that I have available to work with.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">I cycle between controlling my opponents wrists, biceps, triceps, neck, and head in order set-up a control base I want. During this entire process, I don't try to out-muscle or use brute strength, but instead manipulate the spaces that will compromise my opponents center of gravity as they attempt to set-up their own his takedown base.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">One thing I am weary of is the the opponent that chooses to "pull guard". They choose to avoid takedown and clinching and will immediately take me to the ground with them. In my opinion, they are avoiding 1/3 of the skill set that is required by BJJ. I avoid getting pulled into guard so that I can work myself into a strategic takedown instead of starting the match by wasting time having to break someone's guard.</p>
				</div>

<!-- Clinch control -->
				
				<div class="stand-up-control-section">
					<h1 class="clinch sub-section-header">Clinch-Control</h1>
					<p class="clinch sub-section-paragraph">A solid clinch-control game is very important to jiu-jitsu. Most takedowns, grip-fighting, and position-jockeying occur in the clinch on inside the "pocket", the range between competitors where physical contact can be made. In no-gi, the "pocket" I refer to is the proximity where you and your opponent are close enough to hand-fight and establish grips on each other. An entire BJJ match essentially takes place within the pocket. For this reason, controling the clinch is important.</p>

<!-- Takedown section -->
					<h1 class="takedown sub-section-header">Takedowns</h1>
					<p class="takedown sub-section-paragraph">Once I engage in the clinch, I keep a good posture and move constantly to disrupt the timing of my opponents takedowns. I find it useful to keep my posture stable while I focus on my opponents hips. The hips are the main source of power in BJJ and the centerpiece to effective takedowns. Leg shots, hip throws, and trips cannot be achieved without hip engagement.</p>

Your guard is considered an advantageous position, since several attack options are readily available. When I'm in an opponents guard, I am cautious of impeding attacks/sweeps that can stem from it.

In the latter, your opponent forces me to scramble to recover my guard, making me work to prevent their guard pass.
