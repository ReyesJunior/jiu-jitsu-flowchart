					<h1 class="homepage section-description-header">Roll with the tide</h1>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">As a No-Gi Brazilian Jiu-jitsu practitioner, I find that this branch of BJJ is heavily reliant on understanding the fundamentals of human movement and human physiology. This is not to say that Gi-based BJJ does not require that high level of understanding, I assure you that I does. I'm simply pointing out what is obvious, that No-gi BJJ does away with the Gi, the historical and quintessential fixure of the martial art itself.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">No Gi BJJ requires me to interpret and think about my opponents body movement in a entirely different way than before. The Gi was my suit of armor, my sword, and my shield. With all the friction, drag, and material grips that the gi's provide, I could track and control my opponents spacial and temporal movement to attack and defend effectively. Without the Gi, I now have deal with an opponent that can move a lot less restricted than before, with less attacking/defending options at my disposal.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">There exists a vast number of ways to address the differences between the two branches of BJJ, here, I have selected the three components that I regard as immensely important to understand in no Gi BJJ.</p>
				</div> <!-- End of Homepage Section Description Container --> 
<!-- Movement -->
				<h2 class="movement sub-section-header js-section-header" data-target="movement">Movement</h2>
				<div class="movement slider-wrapper" data-id="movement">
					<div class="movement slider-content-container">
						<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">In no-gi grappling there are no sleeves, collars, or pant legs to grab on to. Securing/reversing positions and applying/escaping submissions require the practitioner to grip the opponent's natural body handles to execute efficient movement. Natural body handles include the neck, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. The fast-paced nature of no-gi BJJ makes it more difficult to set-up and execute highly technical, multi-step maneuvers. I've found that continous gross body movement is more helpful, since it harder to grip and slow down a fast-moving, slippery opponent.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
<!-- Strategy -->
				<h2 class="strategy sub-section-header js-section-header" data-target="strategy">Strategy</h2>
				<div class="strategy slider-wrapper" data-id="strategy">
					<div class="strategy slider-content-container">
						<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Since there is no Gi to soak up sweat from rolling, it is easier slip out of unfavorable positions. Conversely, it is equally difficult to pin down an opponent when you have them in a favorable position. As the match increases in duration, sweat becomes an increasingly important factor. More sweat leads to less friction, less friction means less control. Pacing and timing are going to vary greatly from Gi-based grappling as the match progresses. I find no-gi BJJ to be significanlty faster paced and chaining movements to have a much smaller time window. Reaction time and constant movement helps tremendously.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
<!-- Technique -->
				<h2 class="technique sub-section-header js-section-header" data-target="technique">Technique</h2>
				<div class="technique slider-wrapper" data-id="technique">
					<div class="technique slider-content-container">
						<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Without the ability to lock in Gi-based grips on your opponents will change the way techniques are executed. Your ability to cup, palm, post, underhook, overhook, and pin the body and it's natural handles will largely depend on your reaction time and your ability to "swim" into better positions. Establishing and defending advantageous body positioning needed to lock in key grips is crucial to set-up escapes, submissions, and transitioning. I find it best to focus more on "catching" an opponent making a mistake in order to set-up a escape/submission, rather than trying to set them up endlessly for keeping one grip.</p>

					<h1 class="stand-up section-description-header">Stand-up Concepts</h1>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Before I can roll smoothly and flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. I want to take y opponent down and establish a dominant position while preventing him from doing the same to me. I find it best to focus on limiting my time in the clinch, vary my movement speed, and control the amount of space that I have available to work with.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">I cycle between controlling my opponents wrists, biceps, triceps, neck, and head in order set-up a control base I want. During this entire process, I don't try to out-muscle or use brute strength to work my control, I take the space that I want from what they give me and bait them to take space that I want them to take. I feel out my opponents center of gravity, try to predict his takedown maneuver, and react to changes of position resulting from our movement. Ultimately, I want to control and fill the inside of the pocket.</p>

						<p class="open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">One important concept that I have collected from high-level Jiu-Jitsu practictioners is about how to keep control and dictate the flow of the roll. For example, there is a very significant difference between choosing to play open guard vs. having someone get out of your guard. In the former, you are actively choosing to release your closed guard and play with an open guard, allowing you to have multiple avenues to set-up different sweeps, attacks, or guards. In the latter, yur opponent forces the opening of the guard, pretty much leaving you with only one option: Prevent the pass or they are going to pass your guard. Maintain all 4 points of contact is vital. More points of contact you can place n your opponent, the harder it is for the guard passer to impose his will. You must take initiative and control the transition in order to win the most advantageous defensive body positioning. Be aware of actively managing your opponents distance from your hips and neck, their weight, and how much time you give them to react. (Keep you hips on your current defensive strong side)</p>

<!-- Less static control, more flow, more transitions, more options
no lock on opponents legs, attempt to keep 4 points of contact (2 arms, 2 legs), at minimum (1 hip control, 1 leg)
-spider guard (mostly gi) (maintain both wrists, feet on both biceps)
-butterfly guard sweep, leglocks, good transition to half guards
-de la riva (mostly -Gi) (maintain legs wrapped on opponent(one leg around opponents lead leg and other on hip/)) -->
