				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">As a no-Gi BJJ practitioner, I find that this style of jiu-jitsu is heavily reliant on understanding the fundamentals of human movement and physiology. This is not to say that Gi-based BJJ does not require the same high level of understanding, I assure you that I does. I'm simply pointing out what is obvious, that no-Gi BJJ does away with the Gi, the historical and quintessential fixure of the martial art itself.</p>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">I need to interpret and react to my opponent's body movement in a entirely different way than when the Gi is present. The Gi was my suit of armor, my sword, and my shield. Lacking all the friction, drag, and grips that the Gi provides, I have to focus on tracking and controling my opponent in a completely different way. Without the Gi, I now have deal with an opponent that can move a lot less restricted than before, with less attacking/defending options at my disposal.</p>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">There exists a vast number of ways to address the differences between the two branches of BJJ. Here, I have selected the three components that I focus on to improve my no-Gi game.</p>

					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. With no-gi, I prefer to manage space and shoot for leg takedowns. I try to avoid engaging in a clinch-fight. I use constant level-changes and vary my movement speed to expose their legs for the takedown shot.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Lacking, gi grips, It is a little harder for opponents to control me in a no-gi setting long enough to sucessfully pull guard.

The guard is considered an advantageous position, since several attack options are readily available at almost no risk. Without the Gi, I skip the grip-fighting and work to prevent my opponent from initiating a guard-pass by controlling their bodies natural handles. I use underhooks, overhooks, and swim my arms and wrists to effectively breaking down their posture. This helps me ensure I am in a position of control when I begin my attacks/sweeps.</p>

In the latter, your opponent forces me to scramble to recover my guard. Here are some popular variations of the open-guard:<br>Butterfy-guard<br>De la Riva/Reverse De la Riva<br>Inverted-Guard</p>

When I initiate a guard pass, I make sure I maintain good posture and a balanced base. I restrict my opponents movement by simultaneously controlling their hips/legs and apply structural pressure to their guard. When I'm in an opponents guard, I am cautious of exposing space for my opponents to use to initiate attacks/sweeps.s</p>

Traditional gi-based positions require grips in order to fully control your opponent. With no-gi, these position-dominating techniques must be done without grips, focusing more on managing open spaces to block an opponent's sweep/escape. I focus on controlling my opponent's body handles to disrupting your their structural defenses while maintaining my own composure as I obtain my submission.</p>
