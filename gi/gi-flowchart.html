					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is the combat/sport art of submission grappling that specializes in ground fighting and teaches it's practitioners to use techniques that emphasize leverage and timing to defeat an opponent. BJJ has roots stemming from Japanese jujitsu and Judo, which were originally martial arts designed to prepare Samurai warriors for hand-to-hand combat. In 1914, Japanese jujitsu and Judo made their way to Brazil and were introduced to the Gracie family. Helio Gracie, the founder of BJJ, had a frail physique and had to modify the techniques to accomodate for his physical limitations. It was this process, the blending and modification of the two martial art styles, that led Helio Gracie to create a new form of martial art, appropriately named Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph complete-text">Traditionally, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu requires the practitioner to wear a "Gi", a heavy cotton jacket with accompanying heavy cotton trousers. In sparring or in competition, the Gi can be used as an accessory to set-up and execute several attacks, counters, and defenses. The Gi provides a lot of friction and drag when rolling, as well as plenty of fabric to establish grips to control an opponent's movement.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph complete-text">As a practitioner of both forms of BJJ (Gi and No-Gi), there exists significant differences between the two BJJ styles. I use this site to compile, share, and document the knowledge I acquire during my quest to earn my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt. Having all this information in one centralized place will help me reflect about my game while giving me a chance to help others who are curious about BJJ. Below, I have selected the main components that I think are the keys to success for my Gi game.</p>

							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Movement in Brazilian jiu-jitsu is entirely dictated by the amount of movement the hips can generate. The bottom line is that I have to control my opponent's hips <strong>while</strong> preventing my opponent from controlling my own. The Gi plays a very large role in how movement is restricted and controlled. The Gi provides me and my opponent with plenty of real estate to establish grips. I put emphasis in my grip-fighting so that I can gain the upper hand and control my opponents movement before they can have a chance to do the same.</p>
							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">I seek to control my opponent's collar, lapels, sleeves, cuffs, and pants. These grips will help me manage and limit my opponent's hip movements (or body movement's in general) so that I can successfully set up my attacks and defenses while limiting theirs. If I can successfully manipulate my opponents movement, I can dictate the direction and pace of the match.</p>
							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Another factor that I have to consider in Gi-based BJJ is the amount of friction and drag I will encounter when wearing the Gi. My bridging, shrimping, and overall fluidity of movement will be affected by the resistance and friction created between my opponent's Gi, my own Gi, and the mat. Using that logic, I maximize the amount of drag I create on my opponent and apply pressure on their hips to prevent them from moving freely. It's important to know how and when to move correctly and efficiently in order to control their posture and set myself up to execute my techniques.</p>

							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">As the match progresses, the Gi's belts loosen (or come off altogether), exposing the Gi's lapels. These newly exposed lapels introduce an element of risk for me and my opponent, since they can be used to set-up new attacks, counters, and defenses. With the Gi, I prefer to take out the lapels, whether it's my oppponent's or my own. I use the lapel to lock in a tight choke or wrap an opponent's arm to lock it down. When a lapel is used correctly, it will force my opponent to address the issue and expose an opening for me to attack.</p>
							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The Gi, and the techniques that I use, rely on proper grip placement to shut-down the movement of my opponent. Because of this, an opponent will actively work to avoid getting "trapped" in the first place and will use speed and strength to power out of a bad position. Knowing this, I let my opponent "carry my weight" and apply as much pressure on them as possible. This way, as the match progresses, my opponent will expend more energy and make more mistakes while attempting to escape and take some pressure off.</p>
							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">As the match progresses, I play close attention to the amount of energy that I waste. I try to minimize my energy expenditure when I roll by avoiding getting caught in a bad position. I prefer to spend energy early on, preventing my opponent from getting good grips, than having to expend even more energy by forcing a sweep or an escape.</p>

							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The type of techniques that I enjoy to execute when I roll require me to exercise a very large amount of control over my opponent. I use my grips to supress my opponent's ability to create space and prevent them from escaping my attacks. I use the combination of the Gi and my grip placement to "ensnare" my opponent and "trap" them in place so I methodically maneuver them into a submission.</p>
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The slower pace of Gi BJJ, combined with the increased control of my opponent's movement, extends the time I have to chain more complex movement patterns together. The extra time I can afford myself will depend on how much control I can exercise on my opponent. The more movement's I can "sew" together, he more attacking options I have. This will help me set "traps" for my opponents and "bait" them into making a forced movement mistake so that I can extract a submission. The ability to use grips make it more convinent for me set-up and execute highly technical, multi-step techniques.</p>
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Most, if not all, of the Gi-based techniques revolve around the central idea of blocking my oppoenent from using their hips and to compromise the structural intergity of their base. The hips are the real power-house movers in BJJ. Without them, sweeps, attacks, or high-level movement is practically impossible. In addition, i fmy opponent can't keep a good base, they are more readily swept and sumbitted.</p>

				<div class="stand-up section-description-container">
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need to have a solid stand-up game. All I need to do is end up in a dominant position after I take my opponent down. It's much easier said than done. I need to close the distance on my opponent and find the best way to unbalance them so I can execute my takedown. When competing in a Gi, I prefer to use Judo based takedowns (sweeps, trips, and throws) since I can use my grips. The key to a good Judo-style takedown lies in my footwork, the location of my hips (relative to my opponent's), and the placement of my hips. I cycle between controlling my opponents cuffs, lapels, collar, and head in order keep them unbalanced and occupied whlie I set-up my takedown.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph complete-text">Conversely, if my opponent does a better job at establishing grips than me, I have a couple of counter's ready to go. My first line of defense is to not let them get good grips. Assuming that I fail to prevent that, my second-line of defense is to break their grips as quickly as possible before they can set up their takedown. My last line of defense, assuming I can't break their grips, is to work around them and execute a takedown of my own before they can get a chance to.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph complete-text">One thing I am weary about when grip-fighting is the possibility of my opponent "pulling guard" when I seek to take them down. In my opinion, too many BJJ practicioners skip out on the stand-up aspect of the martial art and avoid the stand-up game entirely. I try to avoid getting pulled into a guard by not letting my opponent control my posture and set-up grips on my lapels/collar. I don't want to start a match by wasting time having to break someone's guard when I could have taken them down.</p>

							<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">A solid grip fighting game is very important for Gi-based jiu-jitsu. Most takedowns, attacks, counters, sweeps, and position transitions revolve around maintaining a good base while keeping an advangageous position. Having the proper grips at the right time in the right places will tip the scales in my favor. Admittedly, it takes lots of time and lots of training to have the tools to properly navigate the clinch. In my opinion, an entire BJJ match can be determined by who "wins" the important clinch exchanges. For this reason, controlling what happens in the clinch is an essential aspect of stand-up.</p>
							<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">It is important to note that the clinch game between the Gi and No-Gi BJJ varies significantly. In the Gi, I am training to grip the jacket and push/pull on the material to manipulate my opponent. Training to properly grip and to efficiently manipulate the Gi will work different neuromusular pathways, different movement/behavioral patterns, and ultimately lead me to think about my jiu-jitsu movements differently than in No-Gi.</p>
							<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Clinching with the Gi on will definitely put a lot of wear and tear on my hands and forearms if done incorrectly. I spend most of my grip-fighting/clinch game working to prevent my opponent from getting the upperhand. I rely more on over/underhooks to win positions and grip only when I have to. I focus a lot of my training to mobilize and "prehab" my hands, wrists, and forearms to counter the negative effects of excessive gripping/clinching when I roll.</p>

							<p class="takedown scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Before engaging in a stand-up clinch, I will keep a good low posture with a wide stance and keep my elbows tucked close to my body. The low center of gravity will force my opponent to work a little extra to get under my hips (if they want a successful hip toss), the wide stance will make it harder for my opponent to shoot for a double leg takedown (limiting them to single leg attempts, or sprawl if necessary) and the tucked elbows will kepe them from easy entry for an underhook (plus, it keeps my hands closer to defend my collar/lapels). I focus on my opponents hands and feet to block their entry where necessary.</p>
							<p class="takedown scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Once I engage in the clinch, I actively grip-fight to keep my opponent from taking the upperhand. I try and keep both of my hands busy and engaged in attacking/countering. Leg trips, hip tosses, and throws are more common in the Gi, so I work to break grips, stiff arm their movements to close the distance, and swim over/under their hooks. I protect my collar and lapels while I try to make contact with theirs. Sleeve grips are easier to counter by active "swimming" techniques.</p>
							<p class="takedown scroll-sub-section-paragraph">If I am struggling/losing a grip-fight, I keep track of my opponent's hips and footwork. I seek to prevent them from getting under my own hips or inside my stance in order to neutalize their hip tosses/throws. I will move my body to block teir set-ups and wil capitalize on the counters that I have been working on to beat them to the takedown.</p>

				<h1 class="guard-play section-header">Guard-play<br>Concepts</h1>
				<div class="guard-play section-description-container">
					<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph teaser-text">My Guard is all about breaking down my opponent's posture and bringing their attack to grinding halt. From my guard, I aim to control my opponent long enough to execute a successful sweep/escape (to transition into a more advantageous position), submit them (from specific positions), or generally restrict an opponent's movement to defend myself from their attacks. I seek to break down their posture by controlling their lapels, cuffs, collar, sleeves, legs, arms, and head. I will use all available tools to do so. I will use my grips, legs, hooks, and movements to help me ensure I am in the best possible position to set-up attacks, sweeps, submissions, or escapes.</p>
					<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph complete-text">I've found that relaxing and managing my resources when I am working my guard plays a more important role as the match increases in duration. Staying calm and having a good understanding of what my opponent will try to do to regain posture will help me select the best course of action when deciding wether to sweep, escape, or counter. The more I structurally deconstruct my opponent's posture, the more my opponent will focus on regaining their posture and move away from set-up an attack.</p>
					<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph complete-text">If I can disrupt my opponent from "sewing" their attacks successfully, the I can dedicate more of my energy in controlling the space avaiable within my guard. Ultimately, my opponent will apply lots of pressure (and usually stack their weight) to pass my guard and move into a better position or keep their current attack moving forward. I alleviate the pressure they press onto me by either redirecting their efforts to assist me in a sweep or rely on leverage to create space so I can move around their strength and weight to strengthen my guard.</p>

							<p class="full-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The full guard is considered an advantageous position, since several attack options are readily available for me to use with almost no risk. Normally refered to as a "closed guard", I completely trap my opponent inside my crossed legs. With the Gi, I grip-fight to keep an opponent's grips away from my lapels, hips, or legs to prevent them from initiating a guard-pass. One of two possible senarios will happend when my opponent tries to open my full guard. They will either get their elbows inside my legs to pry my guard open or they will try to stack as much as their weight onto my neck and make me release my guard to alleviate the pressure.</p>
							<p class="full-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">To prevent the prying of my guard, I actively work to keep their posture broken and isolate one arm that I want to attack. That will force my opponent to abandon the pass and focus on protecting their arm. If my opponent decides to stand and stack, it is easier for me to isolate an arm and spin under their weight, causing them to collapse and sweep them. My higher-level training partners are effective with their grip-fighting and are good at regaining their posture, rarely giving me an arm in the process. In these cases, I find it best to "swim" around their grips and work on getting over/under hooks and modifying my guard to keep them from regaining their posture. Wearing my Gi, I prefer to set up and execute several variations of arm-bars, triangles, or chokes from my full-guard, rather than looking for a sweep.</p>

							<p class="half-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The half-Guard requires me to entangle and trap one of my opponents legs to prevent them from moving into a full mount. The key to a successful half-guard is to be able to lay on my side (giving me the option to hip-escape effectively to recover a full guard or sweep) rather than laying flat on my back. I use the arm I am laying on to block an opponent's "cross-face" attempt and seek to get an underhook with my other arm. This basic framing concept will provide me with several options, depending on whether my opponent tries to flatten me out or pass my half-guard. An effective half-guard is designed to transition fluidy between either taking an opponent's back (if I can redirect their pressure) or sweep them onto their back (if I can get tip their center of mass past their base).
							<p class="half-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">From a good half guard, I seek to sweep to a better position or transition to a full-guard. The biggest factor that will dictate how to play my half-guard is the amount of pressure my opponent applies from the top position. If my opponent uses heavy pressure and is assertively attacking, I work to create space and a solid frame to repose my full guard. If my opponent is trying to pass or posture up to regroup, I close the space and secure a sweep.</p>

							<p class="open-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The open guard is designed for keeping an opponent in check while transitioning between different positions, it is not a static guard. When I am transitioning between guards or defending attacks from the "open guard", I try to keep all available limbs and grips busy by keeping as many usefull points of contact on my opponent as possible. My knees, feet, elbows, and grips serve to either create a frame (to preserve a minimum amount of distance to execute efficient movement) or hook onto my opponent (to keep my opponent from creating too much space) to prevent the from moving into a superior position.</p>
							<p class="open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">In my opinion, there is a very distinguishable difference in choosing to play in "open guard" vs. being forced to play my "open guard". In the former, I purposefully open my guard to execute sweeps or attacks that will help me gain an upper hand. In the latter, my opponent is forcing me to scramble to recover my guard or prevent them from gaining any more ground during their attack. This difference becomes increasingly important when i roll with guys who are high level, as they tend to have a solid "open guard" game and often bait me to attack "openings" in their movement.</p>

				<h1 class="guard-passing section-header">Guard-Passing<br>Concepts</h1>
				<div class="guard-passing section-description-container">
				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph teaser-text">One of the most important aspects of BJJ is guard-passing. Guard passing with the Gi has to be very methodical and relies heavily on the placement of my and my opponent's grips. When I initiate a guard pass, I have to make sure that I maintain good posture and that my opponent won't compromise my base (leaving myself open to be swept). Often times my opponent will try to control my posture, disrupt my balance, and manage the space between us control me through my Gi. It's in my best interest to prevent them from locking in good grips or breaking them if they do manage to place them. From my experience, I have found that there are two very different approaches to passing a guard successfully. I can either "Pry" a guard open (through the application of leverage), or "collapse" it shut (through the application of pressure).</p>
				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph complete-text">In addition to limiting my opponent's from effectively restricting my movement, I have to restrict my opponent's if I want to pass their guard successfully. I place grips of my own and combine that with applying good top pressure. My grips limit their ability to move freely and my pressure keeps them flatted out, effectively limiting their guard recovery options. I aim to control their hips/legs and sabotage the structural integrity of their guard, stopping them from initiating a counter-attack or sweep.</p>
				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph complete-text">When passing someone's guard, I have to be mindful of how they shooce to play their guard (will they look for a sweep or counter-attack?). How I proceed to pass my opponent's guard also depends on how they respond to my pressure and techniques. If my opponent has a good guard, they will generally frame and create space to set themselves up for a sweep, so I must respond my keeping tight and taking my time to secure my base and control their hips before I can continue to pass. If my opponent is less mobile and somewhat supressed, I continue to keep heavy top pressure and force them to try to create some space to aleviate my pressure (this usually will force them to make a mistake that I can capitalize on).</p>

							<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">My full-guard passing falls under the "prying" category of guard-passing. When in my opponent's full-guard, I have to be mindful of where I place my hands and cut off the space between my elbows and my body. I can't make the mistake of placing my hands on the mat or have them cross my center-line (or I risk being set-up for an arm bar). I have to try and keep my elbows tucked in close to my body to block my opponent's over/underhooks. My opoonent will be working on establishing grips on my collar, lapels, sleeves, or cuffs to break my posture down and force me to make a mistake, so I grip-fight to bloxk their grips and work to regain my posture.</p>
							<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Once I regain my posture, I have to move on and secure good grips of my own. I work to establish my grips near their hips so that I can safely tuck my elbows tight inside their guard and set-up my lower body into a modified combat base. I apply pressure down through my elbows and, with the use of leverage, pry open their guard to initiate my pass.</p>
							<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">When passing an opponent's full-guard, I have to be careful of my opponent's attempts to re-wrap me and repose their guard. I have to stay tight onto my opponent, apply pressure to keep them from shrimping and fill in any useful space that they create as they move, or else I risk being set-up for a sweep or a submission.</p>

							<p class="pass-half-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">My half-guard passes can be categorized under the "collapsing" style of guard passing. "Collapsing" a guard involves me using pressure and the weight of my body to fold the legs of my opponent together, caving-in their guard and preventing it from reopening as I pass. When I find myself in my opponent's half-guard I have to prevent them from shooting into a deep half-guard. Once the deep-half guard threat has been neutralized, I flatten my opponent onto their back. My opponent can only sweep me or attack me successfully while they are on their side, so flattening them out eliminates their defensive/offensive options.</p>
							<p class="pass-half-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">With the Gi, I seek to get good grips and use my opponent's lapels to hold them flat on their back as I try to find a way to free my trapped leg. Often times, My opponent's will use the "lock down" half-guard variation on me to relieve some pressure and force me to stop my guard pass. I just have to make sure I have good grips on my opponenet's hips (to prevent them from moving effectively) and will use my own legs to "untie the knot" from the "lockdown" position. Once my leg is free, I can continue my pass.</p>
							<p class="pass-half-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">At this point, my opponent will be trying to create a frame and shrimp-out from underneath me as I pass. To neutralie this, I apply good shoulder pressure onto their hips as I grip their collar/lapels to keep them from moving away. I change the angle of my hips to "knee slice" my trapped leg out and finish passing their half-guard.</p>

						<div class="pass-open-guard slider-content-container">
							<p class="pass-open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Open guard passing is much harder to categorize, since it is not a static guard and there are several moving parts involved with "passing it". To pass, I have to be able to be active and vary my movement speed and direction constantly to counter whatever my opponent throws at me. My opponent's will generally try to wrap around and isolate one of my legs (if I am standing) or seek to establish as many points of contact with me to control my movement. Most opponents will try to set-up some variations of the following: de la riva guard, butterfly guard, spider-guard, cross-guard, or grasshopper-guard.</p>
							<p class="pass-open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">All the guards mentioned above have a two basic qualities in common (that I must address if I am to successfully pass my opponent's guard). The first quality the aformentioned open-guards have in common are the grips my opponent has on my lapel's and/or cuffs. I have to break these so that I can have a good posture and have my hands free to grip my opponent and restrict their movement. The second quality is the fact the my opponent will use their legs/feet to manipulate my hips and legs. I have to be weary of that and not let my opponent get deep hooks in to compromise my balance.</p>
							<p class="pass-open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Once I've addressed the dangers that accompany my opponent's open-guard, I can begin to pass. I look to expose openings in my opponent's open-guard so that I can go over, around, or underneath these spaces and successfully pass. I like to establish grips on my opponents legs (just below the knees) to simultaneously prevent them from manupulating my lower body and to limit their leg and hip movement. I proceed to find a way past my opponent's legs and drop my weight (either through my hips or shoulders) onto my opponent's hips to keep them from escaping. I immediately re-grip my opponent to hold them in place to prevent them from reposing any of their guards successfully, completing my pass.</p>

					<p class="dominating section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Submitting an opponent is trickier than most people think. When an opponent is trapped in a compromised position, their mindset immediately shifts to a "defend at all costs" mindset, making it very difficult to submit them. In addition to having an elevated defensive mindset, the higher the level an opponent is, the more sophisticated their defenses and escapes are supposed to be, only adding to the difficulty of extracting a submission. Fortunately for me, everyone can be submitted. I can increase my chances of extracting a submission from an opponent by increasing the amount of mistakes that they make, increasing the chances for me to attack. I can create more chances to attack my opponent the longer I can maintain a dominant position. I think the "position before submission" mindset is key when I look to finish opponents.</p>
					<p class="dominating section-description-paragraph complete-text">I use my grips to maintain control of an opponent when I am in a dominant position. These grips, along with strategic weight and pressure allocation, help me disrupt my opponent's defenses so I can keep them from escaping. I emphasize controlling their hips and not allowing them to create any space that can help them move into a better position. In addition to keeping pressure on the hips, I also use the Gi to pin them down and keep them as flat as possible when I move about the dominant position. I like to deconstruct and break down the ability that my opponent has to create a frame against my pressure my isolating their arms whenever possible.</p>
					<p class="dominating section-description-paragraph complete-text">The final finishing touches that I add to maintaining my opponent under control is to set-up "traps" and "bait" them to attempt escapes that I am prepared to counter. I dont like to pry and force a submission, but I like to trick them into opening up and giving me the space I want to improve my position instead. I find the most important detail when attacking and baiting is to keep a solid base and shut down their sweeping attempts. It's important to be able to "string" together secondary and teritary attacking options (should I miss a primary or secondary submission attempt). I need to dominate and control my opponent long enough to obtain my submission.</p>

							<p class="dominating-mount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Arguably the most dominant position in BJJ, maintaining control of the mount requires a good sense of balance. My opponent will try to bridge and do whatever they can to create enough space to recover their half-guard or sweep me onto my back (and end up in my full-guard). In order for me to avoid those problems, I have to focus on keeping a very wide (and heavy) base, prevent my opponent from pushing on my knees (to extend and trap one of my legs), and prevent my opponent from trapping an arm (to stop the trap-and-bridge sweep). I flare my knees out and tuck my feet tight under my opponent's thighs to secure my base and use my free hands to attack their collar and lapels. By bugging their neck and threatening to sink in a choke, my opponent is forced to use their hands to counter my attack, keep their hands away from pushing my knees (otherwise I will execute an easy collar/lapel choke).
							<p class="dominating-mount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">One other importnant detail about the mount is that I must be able to transition fluidly between the standard variation of the mount into a technical-mount/s-mount, should my opponent manage to turn on their side while I am on top. I must be able to "surf" my opponent's rolling maneuvers and be prepared to shift my weight around to maintain my posture and position, regardless how much they move underneath me. My hands are kept active by posting when my base is threatened or attack when my opponent makes a mistake in their escape attempts.</p>

							<p class="dominating-sidecontrol scroll-sub-section-paragraph">To keep good a side-control I have to prevent my opponent from turning onto their side and keep them flat on their back. With the Gi, I take advantage of my grips and use them to control my opponent's hips and shoulders. The most important thing that I need to keep control of on my opponent, regardless of which side-control variation I use, are their hips. I have to use my hips, knees, grips, and elbows to keep their hips in check and prevent my opponent from turning into me and bringing their knees between us to recover their guard. Once I can keep them flat and unable to turn to recover their guard, I begin my attack.</p>
							<p class="dominating-sidecontrol scroll-sub-section-paragraph">My opponent will usually either use their hands and forearms to frame against my neck or seek to sneak in underhooks to create the space needed to escape. If my opponent frames, I like to use their lapel on the same side to wrap it around the framing forearm and pin it against their own body, negating their frame. If my opponent underhooks, I reach behind their neck to grip their same side lapel (taking all the slack out) and move to place my knee on their belly, preventing them from effectively turning into me. In both situations, my opponent cannot recover their guard and allows me to continue my attacks as I maintain a stable side-control.</p>

						<div class="dominating-north-south slider-content-container">
							<p class="dominating-north-south scroll-sub-section-paragraph">I prefer moving into the north-south position when I transition from one side-control to another. The advantage of the norht-south position is that I can keep control on my oponent and expose an arm or attack for a choke while I transition. I keep the north-south position by gripping and controlling my opponent's hips while using a shoulder to drive my body weight down onto their belly. The combination of the shoulder pressure and hip control will minimize the effects of my opponent's bridging attempts when they try to escape. I have to make sure that I am on my toes and off my knees so that my opponent can't effectively grab onto one of my legs and disrupt my movement. This tripod position gives me great control and will usually force my opponent to try and turn into one side, exposing an arm for me to attack, giving me the option to take their back, or secure a modified collar/lapel choke (if I had begun to set one up earlier).</p>
							<p class="dominating-north-south scroll-sub-section-paragraph">If I am unable to tripod and tip-toe the north-south position, I can also get it through my knees. The difference is that I would go chest to chest and my clamp my elbows tight to their body, tucked underneath their armpits to prevent them from turning and escaping. I would still hold on to their hips and sprawl out, using my own hips to drive their heads flat onto one side. This will force my opponent to alleviate some of the pressure and make them use their arms to frame against my hips, giving me a chance to attack them.</p>
							<p class="dominating-north-south scroll-sub-section-paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, I like to slip into the north-south position only during transition (I don't like to stay there very long). In either case, whether I stand and tripod or sprawl, most my opponent's try to bring their knees under my armpits to try and roll me over them. If I can't force them to make a mistake or create an entry point that I can attack, I move on to another position.</p>
