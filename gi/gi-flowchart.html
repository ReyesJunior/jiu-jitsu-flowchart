				<h1 class="homepage section-description-header">Wreathe with fluidity</h1>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the art of submission grappling against a much larger and stronger opponent. It is a child of Japanese jujitsu, a martial art designed for Samurai warriors. "Ju" means flexibility and "jitsu" means skill or art, so the name translates to "the gentle art". BJJ introduced the ground fighting aspect to the japanese style and changed the name from "jujitsu" to "jiu-jitsu". This martial art uses techniques based on leverage and efficient movement to joint-lock or stangle an opponent.</p>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">Traditionally, Jiu-jitsu requires the practitioner to wear a "Gi", a heavy cotton jacket and trousers. The Gi can be used as a weapon to attack the opponent as well as a defensive tool to restrict an opponents movement. The GI provides a lot of friction, drag, and grips for both opponents, allowing for more control of movement. Practitioners use the Gi, and their knowledge of techniques to set-up attacks, sweeps, and defenses against other opponents.</p>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">There exists a vast number of ways to address the differences between the two branches of BJJ, here, I have selected the three components that I focus on to improve my Gi game.</p>

					<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The Gi gives me plenty of grips to work with, so I put lots of emphasis on grip-fighting to set-up my movement. I grip fight to catch my opponent's collar, lapel, sleeves, cuffs, and pants, to control them.</p>
					<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Increased friction makes Gi BJJ slower-paced. It is tougher to escape from bad positions, so I fight to not get caught in them in the first place. On the other hand, the slower tempo makes it easier for me set-up and execute a highly technical, multi-step maneuvers when my grips are established.</p>

					<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Slower movement and increased control extends the time I have to think and chain complex movement patterns together. I rely more on constant, fluid movement to "trap" my opponent by "pinning" them down to extract a submission.</p>

					<h1 class="stand-up section-description-header">Stand-up Concepts</h1>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. I like to take my opponent down by tracking how they react and move to keep their stability when I try to unbalance them. Ultimately, I want to control and fill the inside of the pocket. I find it best to focus on limiting my time in the clinch, vary my movement speed, and control the amount of space that I have available to work with.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">I cycle between controlling my opponents wrists, biceps, triceps, neck, and head in order set-up a control base I want. During this entire process, I don't try to out-muscle or use brute strength, but instead manipulate the spaces that will compromise my opponents center of gravity as they attempt to set-up their own his takedown base.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">One thing I am weary of is the the opponent that chooses to "pull guard". They choose to avoid takedown and clinching and will immediately take me to the ground with them. In my opinion, they are avoiding 1/3 of the skill set that is required by BJJ. I avoid getting pulled into guard so that I can work myself into a strategic takedown instead of starting the match by wasting time having to break someone's guard.</p>

						<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">A solid clinch-control game is very important to jiu-jitsu. Most takedowns, grip-fighting, and position-jockeying occur in the clinch on inside the "pocket", the range between competitors where physical contact can be made. In gi, the "pocket" I refer to is the proximity where you and your opponent are close enough to hand-fight and establish grips on each other. An entire BJJ match essentially takes place within the pocket. For this reason, controling the clinch is important.</p>

				<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph">The Guard is all about control. From your guard, you can sweep, submit, and restrict an opponents movement. Your guard is considered an advantageous position, since several attack options are readily available. When I'm in an opponents guard, I am cautious of impeding attacks/sweeps that can stem from it. I focus on restoring my posture and passing their guard onto a more dominant position in order to seek a submission.</p>

In the latter, your opponent forces me to scramble to recover my guard, making me work to prevent their guard pass.

When I initiate a guard pass, I make sure I maintain good posture and seek to restrict my opponents movement by simultaneously controlling their hips/legs and apply structural pressure on their guard.</p>
