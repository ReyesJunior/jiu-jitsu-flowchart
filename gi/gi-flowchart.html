					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the art of submission grappling. This martial art teaches it's practitioners how to defend against a much larger and stronger opponent. Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) stems from Japanese jujitsu, a martial art designed originally for preparing Samurai warriors for combat. BJJ introduced ground fighting to the japanese version and changed the name from "jujitsu" to "jiu-jitsu". "Ju" translates to flexibility, "jitsu" translates to skill or art. BJJ uses techniques based on leverage and efficient movement to joint-lock or strangle an opponent in an fluid manner. Brazilian jiu-jitsu is known as the "the gentle art".</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph complete-text">Traditionally, Jiu-jitsu requires the practitioner, to wear a "Gi" or kimono, a heavy cotton jacket with accompanying heavy cotton trousers. The Gi can be used as a weapon in BJJ. The GI provides a lot of friction, drag, and grips that allow me to control my opponent's movement. I use the Gi, and my growing knowledge of BJJ techniques, to set-up attacks, sweeps, and defenses against my opponents.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph complete-text">As a practitioner of both forms of BJJ (Gi and No-Gi), there exists significant differences between the two. I use this site to gather and compile the tips and tricks that I aquire over my Jiu-jitsu journey that with help me improve and think about my game. Below, I have selected the main components that I think are the keys to success for my Gi game.</p>

							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The Gi gives me plenty of real estate for me to establish grips on my opponent, so I put lots of emphasis on grip-fighting. I grip-fight to control my opponent's collar, lapels, sleeves, cuffs, and pants. I use my grips to manage and limit my opponent's movement so that I can successfully set up my attacks and defenses.</p>
							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Gi-based BJJ requires me to master grip-fighting, grip placement and apply pressure onto my opponent. It's important to know how and when to move correctly in order to control their posture so that I can set myself up to execute my techniques.</p>
							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">I pay extra attention on where I place my grips so that I can maximize my ability to manipulate my opponent's range of motion. If I can successfully manipulate my opponents movement, I can dictate the direction and pace of the match.</p>

							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">As belts loosen, or come off altogether, the Gi's lapels are exposed. These lapels introduce a new element of risk for me and my opponent. I use the newly exposed lapels to set-up new attacks and defenses. With the Gi, I prefer to attack my opponent when I expose an opening in their movement.</p>
							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The slower pace of Gi BJJ, combined with the increased control of my opponent's movement, extends the time I have to chain complex movement patterns together. I rely on setting "traps" for my opponents and "bait" them into making a mistake so that I can extract a submission.</p>
							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">As the match progresses, I play close attention to the amount of energy that I waste. I try to minimize my energy expenditure when I roll by avoiding getting caught in a bad position. I prefer to spend energy preventing my opponent from getting good grips and taking an advantageous position rather than having to expend even more energy after the fact by forcing a sweep or an escape.</p>

							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">With the ability to grip and hold my opponent, I execute my techniques without having to lose control over them. I rely on the Gi to help me "ensnare" my opponent and "trap" them in place as I methodically maneuver them into submission.</p>
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Since Gi techniques rely on controlling movement, it is tougher for me and my opponent to escape from bad positions. Because of this, I proactively work to avoid getting trapped in them in the first place. The slower tempo and Gi grips make it more convinent for me set-up and execute highly technical, multi-step techniques.</p>
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Most, if not all, of the Gi-based techniques revolve around the central idea of blocking my oppoenent from using their hips. The hips are the real power-house movers in BJJ. Without them, sweeps, attacks, or high-level movement is practically impossible.</p>

					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. I establish grips with the intention to unbalance my opponent and set-up a takedown. I prefer to sweep, trip, or throw my opponent when in the Gi. I find it best to grip fight, set-up my footwork, and drop my hips in the correct positions to get a takedown. I cycle between controlling my opponents cuffs, lapels, and head in order keep them unbalanced and occupied defending my takedowns.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph complete-text">If my opponent does establish better grips than me, I have a couple of counter's ready to go. My first line of defense is to not let them get goos grips. My second-line of defense is to break their grips before they can set up their takedown. My last line of defense is to work around their grips and execute my takedown attempt before they can execute their own.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph complete-text">One thing I am weary of is the the opponent that chooses to "pull guard". In my opinion, they are avoiding 1/3 of the skill set that is required for BJJ by avoiding the stand-up/takedown portion of the game. I avoid getting pulled into guard by grip fighting, not letting them control my posture, and keep a safe amount of space between their hips and mine. I don't want to start a match by wasting time having to break someone's guard.</p>

Guard passing with the Gi is very methodical and relys heavily on the location of your grips. When I initiate a guard pass, I make sure I maintain good posture and a balanced base.

When I'm in an opponents guard, I am cautious of exposing space for my opponents to use to initiate attacks/sweeps.</p>

						<p class="dominating-backmount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Keeping control of the back mount depends on the effectiveness of my grip-fighting on my opponents collar and how active my leg hooks are. I ensure to keep my opponent busy by grip-fighting for their collar to sink in a choke. Simultaneously, I use my leg hooks to prevent my opponent from turning on their side or escaping. These two techniques afford me control as I look for a submission.</p>

Recognizing how to create and close off space to set up my escape.<br>These three concepts will help me compromise my opponents balance, disrupt their attacks, and provide me the space to escape and repose my guard.</p>

						<p class="dominated-mount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">In the gi, collar chokes are very common so I tuck my arms tight to protect my neck. Under my opponent's mount, I hip bump and turn sideways to reach and trap of my opponent's same-side leg hook. When the hook is trapped, I push on their knee and shrimp out to create space for my leg to establish a half-guard. I repeat the process to the other side to get a full-guard. If I can't undo a leg hook, I simply trap their same-side ankle and arm to bridge in that direction to sweep and end-up in their full-guard.</p>

I simultaneously hip bump into them and push their neck away to give me the space I need to hip escape away onto my side. I immediately swivel my hips and knee back underneath them and all the way to the other side into a modified butterfly-esque guard.

From underneath them, I push their head to one side so that my far-side arm can underhook it while I raise my near-side arm to protect the newly created space.

Most opponents "seat belt" me, wrapping the top arm around my neck and the bottom gripping my lapel. To escape, I defend my neck by tucking my chin in towards the elbow that is around my neck and drop on the side of the underhooked arm. I use an arm to securing my opponent's top arm and prevent it from locking in the choke and use my other arm to strip their grip on my bottom lapel. As we fall, I release myself from their bottom leg hook as I shift my hips out to turn and face them. I finish my escape by traping their top leg between my own to get into a modified half-guard.</p>
