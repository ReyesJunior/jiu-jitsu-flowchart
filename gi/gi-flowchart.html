					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">As a no-Gi BJJ practitioner, I find that this style of jiu-jitsu is heavily reliant on understanding the fundamentals of human movement and physiology. This is not to say that Gi-based BJJ does not require the same high level of understanding, I assure you that I does. I'm simply pointing out what is obvious, that no-Gi BJJ does away with the Gi, the historical and quintessential fixure of the martial art itself.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">I need to interpret and react to my opponents body movements in a entirely different way than with the Gi. The Gi was my suit of armor, my sword, and my shield. With all the friction, drag, and grips that the Gi provides, I could track and control my opponents movement to set-up attacks and defensive positions effectively. Without the Gi, I now have deal with an opponent that can move a lot less restricted than before, with less attacking/defending options at my disposal.</p>
					<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">There exists a vast number of ways to address the differences between the two branches of BJJ, here, I have selected the three components that I focus on to improve my no-Gi game.</p>

						<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Lacking Gi grips, I must use opponent's natural body handles to control their movement. My opponents neck, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles will provide these handles for me.</p>
						<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Significantly reduced friction makes no-Gi BJJ fast-paced. It is tough to slow down a slick, fast opponent. The faster tempo makes it tricky to set-up and execute a highly technical, multi-step maneuver.</p>

						<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Faster movement and reduced control reduces the time I have to think and chain complex movement patterns together.

						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Before I can roll smoothly and flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. I want to take y opponent down and establish a dominant position while preventing him from doing the same to me. I find it best to focus on limiting my time in the clinch, vary my movement speed, and control the amount of space that I have available to work with.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">I cycle between controlling my opponents wrists, biceps, triceps, neck, and head in order set-up a control base I want. During this entire process, I don't try to out-muscle or use brute strength to work my control, I take the space that I want from what they give me and bait them to take space that I want them to take. I feel out my opponents center of gravity, try to predict his takedown maneuver, and react to changes of position resulting from our movement. Ultimately, I want to control and fill the inside of the pocket.</p>

						<p class="open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">One important concept that I have collected from high-level Jiu-Jitsu practictioners is about how to keep control and dictate the flow of the roll. For example, there is a very significant difference between choosing to play open guard vs. having someone get out of your guard. In the former, you are actively choosing to release your closed guard and play with an open guard, allowing you to have multiple avenues to set-up different sweeps, attacks, or guards. In the latter, yur opponent forces the opening of the guard, pretty much leaving you with only one option: Prevent the pass or they are going to pass your guard. Maintain all 4 points of contact is vital. More points of contact you can place n your opponent, the harder it is for the guard passer to impose his will. You must take initiative and control the transition in order to win the most advantageous defensive body positioning. Be aware of actively managing your opponents distance from your hips and neck, their weight, and how much time you give them to react. (Keep you hips on your current defensive strong side)</p>

<!-- Less static control, more flow, more transitions, more options
no lock on opponents legs, attempt to keep 4 points of contact (2 arms, 2 legs), at minimum (1 hip control, 1 leg)
-spider guard (mostly gi) (maintain both wrists, feet on both biceps)
-butterfly guard sweep, leglocks, good transition to half guards
-de la riva (mostly -Gi) (maintain legs wrapped on opponent(one leg around opponents lead leg and other on hip/)) -->
