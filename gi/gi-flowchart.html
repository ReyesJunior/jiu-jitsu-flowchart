				<h1 class="homepage section-description-header">Wreathe with fluidity</h1>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is the art of submission grappling against a much larger and stronger opponent. It is a child of Japanese jujitsu, a martial art designed for Samurai warriors. BJJ introduced the ground fighting aspect to the japanese version and changed the name from "jujitsu" to "jiu-jitsu". "Ju" translates to flexibility and "jitsu" translates to skill or art. BJJ uses techniques based on leverage and efficient movement to joint-lock or strangle an opponent in an efficient and fluid manner, making brazilian jiu-jitsu known as the "the gentle art".</p>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">Traditionally, Jiu-jitsu requires the practitioner to wear a "Gi" or the kimono, a heavy cotton jacket and trousers. The Gi "uniform" can be used as a weapon to attack my opponents as well as a defensive tool to fend of attacks. The GI provides a lot of friction, drag, and grips that allow me more control of my opponent movement. I use the Gi, and my knowledge of techniques to set-up attacks, sweeps, and defenses against my opponents.</p>
				<p class="homepage section-description-paragraph">There exists a vast number of ways to address the differences between the two branches of BJJ. Here, I have selected the three components that I focus on to improve my Gi game.</p>

					<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The Gi gives me plenty of grips to work with, so I put lots of emphasis on grip-fighting to facilitate my movement. I control my opponent by controlling their collar, lapel, sleeves, cuffs, and pants.</p>

					<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Since Gi techniques allow for more movement control, it is tougher to escape from bad positions. I proactively work to avoid getting trapped in them in the first place. The slower tempo and Gi grips make it more convinent for me set-up and execute highly technical, multi-step techniques.</p>

					<h1 class="stand-up section-description-header">Stand-up Concepts</h1>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need a solid stand-up game. I establish grips to unbalance my opponent to execute a takedown. I prefer to sweep, trip, or throw when in the Gi. I find it best to grip fight, set-up my footwork, and place my hips in correct positions to get the takedown. I cycle between controlling my opponents cuffs, lapels, and head in order set-up my clinch-control.</p>
						<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph">One thing I am weary of is the the opponent that chooses to "pull guard". In my opinion, they are avoiding 1/3 of the skill set that is required by BJJ. I avoid getting pulled into guard by grip fighting and not letting them control my posture. I don't want to start a match by wasting time having to break someone's guard.</p>

						<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">A solid grip fighting game is very important for Gi-based jiu-jitsu.

For this reason, controlling what happens in the clinch is important.</p>

I find it useful to keep my posture low while I focus on my opponents hands and feet. Leg trips, hip tosses, and throws are more common in the Gi. If I lose a grip-fight, I keep track of my opponent's hips to prevent them from getting under my own in order to neutalize their hip tosses/throws.</p>

				<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph">My Guard is all about controlling my opponent. From my guard, I can sweep, submit, and restrict an opponent. The guard is considered an advantageous position, since several attack options are readily available at almost no risk. I seek to break down their posture by controlling their lapels, cuffs, and collar. This helps me ensure I am in a position of control when I begin my attacks/sweeps.</p>

					<p class="full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Normally refered to as a "closed guard", I completely trap my opponent inside my crossed legs. With the Gi, I grip-fight to keep an opponent's grips away from my hips or legs to prevent them from initiating a guard-pass. I prefer setting up arm-bars or triangles when my opponents leave an arm exposed regaining posture. The key for me to attack from my full guard is to keep my oponents posture broken and off balance.

There is a difference in choosing to play "open guard" vs. being forced to play "open guard". In the former, I purposefully open my guard to execute multiple sweeps or attacks. In the latter, your opponent forces me to scramble to recover my guard. Here are some popular variations of the open-guard:<br>Butterfy-guard<br>De la Riva/Reverse De la Riva<br>Inverted-Guard</p>

				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph">One of the most important aspects of BJJ is guard-passing. Guard passing with the Gi is very methodical and relys heavily on the location of your grips. When I initiate a guard pass, I make sure I maintain good posture and a balanced base. I restrict my opponents movement by simultaneously controlling their hips/legs and apply structural pressure to their guard. When I'm in an opponents guard, I am cautious of exposing space for my opponents to use to initiate attacks/sweeps.</p>

					<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Full-guard passes can be categorized into two types: "Prying" or "collapsing" the guard. "Prying" involves opening your opponents legs and preventing them from rewrapping you. "Collapsing" involves folding their legs together, preventing them from reopening as you pass. When passing, fill useful space your opponent gives up, or else you risk being set-up for a sweep or a submission.</p>

With the Gi, I prefer to move into a modified scarf hold with my free leg establishing a wide base. From there, I apply shoulder pressure and change the angle of my hips to "knee slice" my trapped leg out. To avoid being swept, the base I create with my pressuring shoulder and free leg must be balanced.</p>

Since the position is fluid, I "surf" my opoonent to keep balance and avoid being swept.

I use my elbow to hold my opponent's knee in place as I shrimp out, sliding my bottom leg out that space to establish half-guard. I repeat this on the other side to get my guard.
