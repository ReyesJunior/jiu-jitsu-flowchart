				<div class="guard-passing section-description-container">
				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph teaser-text">One of the most important aspects of BJJ is guard-passing. Guard passing with the Gi has to be very methodical and relies heavily on the placement of my and my opponent's grips. When I initiate a guard pass, I have to make sure that I maintain good posture and that my opponent won't compromise my base (leaving myself open to be swept). Often times my opponent will try to control my posture, disrupt my balance, and manage the space between us control me through my Gi. It's in my best interest to prevent them from locking in good grips or breaking them if they do manage to place them. From my experience, I have found that there are two very different approaches to passing a guard successfully. I can either "Pry" a guard open (through the application of leverage), or "collapse" it shut (through the application of pressure).</p>
				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph complete-text">In addition to limiting my opponent's from effectively restricting my movement, I have to restrict my opponent's if I want to pass their guard successfully. I place grips of my own and combine that with applying good top pressure. My grips limit their ability to move freely and my pressure keeps them flatted out, effectively limiting their guard recovery options. I aim to control their hips/legs and sabotage the structural integrity of their guard, stopping them from initiating a counter-attack or sweep.</p>
				<p class="guard-passing section-description-paragraph complete-text">When passing someone's guard, I have to be mindful of how they shooce to play their guard (will they look for a sweep or counter-attack?). How I proceed to pass my opponent's guard also depends on how they respond to my pressure and techniques. If my opponent has a good guard, they will generally frame and create space to set themselves up for a sweep, so I must respond my keeping tight and taking my time to secure my base and control their hips before I can continue to pass. If my opponent is less mobile and somewhat supressed, I continue to keep heavy top pressure and force them to try to create some space to aleviate my pressure (this usually will force them to make a mistake that I can capitalize on).</p>

							<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">My full-guard passing falls under the "prying" category of guard-passing. When in my opponent's full-guard, I have to be mindful of where I place my hands and cut off the space between my elbows and my body. I can't make the mistake of placing my hands on the mat or have them cross my center-line (or I risk being set-up for an arm bar). I have to try and keep my elbows tucked in close to my body to block my opponent's over/underhooks. My opoonent will be working on establishing grips on my collar, lapels, sleeves, or cuffs to break my posture down and force me to make a mistake, so I grip-fight to bloxk their grips and work to regain my posture.</p>
							<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Once I regain my posture, I have to move on and secure good grips of my own. I work to establish my grips near their hips so that I can safely tuck my elbows tight inside their guard and set-up my lower body into a modified combat base. I apply pressure down through my elbows and, with the use of leverage, pry open their guard to initiate my pass.</p>
							<p class="pass-full-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">When passing an opponent's full-guard, I have to be careful of my opponent's attempts to re-wrap me and repose their guard. I have to stay tight onto my opponent, apply pressure to keep them from shrimping and fill in any useful space that they create as they move, or else I risk being set-up for a sweep or a submission.</p>

<!-- Pass Half-guard -->

				<div class="pass-half-guard guard-passing slider-container">
					<div class="pass-half-guard guard-passing slider-wrapper" data-id="pass-half-guard">
						<div class="pass-half-guard slider-content-container">
							<p class="pass-half-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">My half-guard passes can be categorized under the "collapsing" style of guard passing. "Collapsing" a guard involves me using pressure and the weight of my body to fold the legs of my opponent together, caving-in their guard and preventing it from reopening as I pass. When I find myself in my opponent's half-guard I have to prevent them from shooting into a deep half-guard. Once the deep-half guard threat has been neutralized, I flatten my opponent onto their back. My opponent can only sweep me or attack me successfully while they are on their side, so flattening them out eliminates their defensive/offensive options.</p>
							<p class="pass-half-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">With the Gi, I seek to get good grips and use my opponent's lapels to hold them flat on their back as I try to find a way to free my trapped leg. Often times, My opponent's will use the "lock down" half-guard variation on me to relieve some pressure and force me to stop my guard pass. I just have to make sure I have good grips on my opponenet's hips (to prevent them from moving effectively) and will use my own legs to "untie the knot" from the "lockdown" position. Once my leg is free, I can continue my pass.</p>
							<p class="pass-half-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">At this point, my opponent will be trying to create a frame and shrimp-out from underneath me as I pass. To neutralie this, I apply good shoulder pressure onto their hips as I grip their collar/lapels to keep them from moving away. I change the angle of my hips to "knee slice" my trapped leg out and finish passing their half-guard.</p>

<!-- Pass Open-guard -->

					<div class="pass-open-guard guard-passing slider-wrapper" data-id="pass-open-guard">
						<div class="pass-open-guard slider-content-container">
							<p class="pass-open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Open guard passing is much harder to categorize, since it is not a static guard and there are several moving parts involved with "passing it". To pass, I have to be able to be active and vary my movement speed and direction constantly to counter whatever my opponent throws at me. My opponent's will generally try to wrap around and isolate one of my legs (if I am standing) or seek to establish as many points of contact with me to control my movement. Most opponents will try to set-up some variations of the following: de la riva guard, butterfly guard, spider-guard, cross-guard, or grasshopper-guard.</p>
							<p class="pass-open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">All the guards mentioned above have a two basic qualities in common (that I must address if I am to successfully pass my opponent's guard). The first quality the aformentioned open-guards have in common are the grips my opponent has on my lapel's and/or cuffs. I have to break these so that I can have a good posture and have my hands free to grip my opponent and restrict their movement. The second quality is the fact the my opponent will use their legs/feet to manipulate my hips and legs. I have to be weary of that and not let my opponent get deep hooks in to compromise my balance.</p>
							<p class="pass-open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Once I've addressed the dangers that accompany my opponent's open-guard, I can begin to pass. I look to expose openings in my opponent's open-guard so that I can go over, around, or underneath these spaces and successfully pass. I like to establish grips on my opponents legs (just below the knees) to simultaneously prevent them from manupulating my lower body and to limit their leg and hip movement. I proceed to find a way past my opponent's legs and drop my weight (either through my hips or shoulders) onto my opponent's hips to keep them from escaping. I immediately re-grip my opponent to hold them in place to prevent them from reposing any of their guards successfully, completing my pass.</p>
