					<p class="dominated section-description-paragraph teaser-text">From my experience, successfully defending against an opponent's attacks (and escaping from bad positions) can be broken down into 3 elements. The first element in my defense/escape strategy is to recognize when I have lost control of a good position. The faster I realize that I have lost control of an advantage, that faster I can move to either recover the position or set-up my defenses in preparation for my opponent's counter attacks. The real key to successful defenses and escapes is to be one step ahead of my opponent. I don't easily give up a good position when I have one, but higher level opponents are tricky and often times will find a way to slip out and turn the tables on me. If there's one thing I've learned in jiu-jitsu, it's that there's always a counter to an attack (and a counter to that counter, and counter that counters that counter, etc) and that any position can be reversed. The good news is, that regardless of what my opponent does, I will have a defense or escape option ready to counter their attacks.</p>
					<p class="dominated section-description-paragraph complete-text">The second element in my defense/escape strategy is to recognize and limit what my opponent's attacking options are, depending on what position me and my opponent find ourselves in. If my opponent has my back, I already know that they are seeking a collar and lapel grip to try and set-up a choke, so I guard my neck and work to disrupt their grip-fighting. If I am in my opponent's guard, I already know that they want to isolate one of my arms or start to a triangle set-up, so I keep my elbows tight to my body as I grip-fight to protect my arms from being controlled. The important thing is that I try and stay one step ahead of my opponent and correctly anticipate possible counters to my defenses (this will be a product of training, drilling, reaction time, and the cumulation of experience).</p>
					<p class="dominated section-description-paragraph complete-text">The final component of my defense/escape strategy is to be able to effectively manage the space and distance between me and my opponent. I have to be able to identify how, when, and where to create space (or limit the space) between me and my opponent's movement and positioning if I want to increase my chances of defending and escaping from a bad position. I have to find the holes in my opponent's attacks and make sure that I exploit them to sucessfully execute my sweeps and escapes. Understanding when and how to move in order to destabilize and breakdown my opponent's attacking options is important so that I can preserve my energy and always keep an edge over my opponent.</p>

							<p class="dominated-mount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">In the gi, collar chokes are very common so I tuck my arms tight to protect my neck. Under my opponent's mount, I hip bump and turn sideways to reach and trap of my opponent's same-side leg hook. When the hook is trapped, I push on their knee and shrimp out to create space for my leg to establish a half-guard. I repeat the process to the other side to get a full-guard. If I can't undo a leg hook, I simply trap their same-side ankle and arm to bridge in that direction to sweep and end-up in their full-guard.</p>

							<p class="dominated-sidecontrol scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The key to escape or sweep my opponent from their side-control is to not let them flatten me out. If I am flattened out, I secure a frame on their neck with my near-side arm to prevent it from being isolated. I simultaneously hip bump into them and push their neck away to give me the space I need to hip escape away onto my side. I immediately swivel my hips and knee back underneath them and all the way to the other side into a modified butterfly-esque guard. I hip escape once more to lock in a full-guard to finish my escape.</p>

From underneath them, I push their head to one side so that my far-side arm can underhook it while I raise my near-side arm to protect the newly created space.

Most opponents "seat belt" me, wrapping the top arm around my neck and the bottom gripping my lapel. To escape, I defend my neck by tucking my chin in towards the elbow that is around my neck and drop on the side of the underhooked arm. I use an arm to securing my opponent's top arm and prevent it from locking in the choke and use my other arm to strip their grip on my bottom lapel. As we fall, I release myself from their bottom leg hook as I shift my hips out to turn and face them. I finish my escape by traping their top leg between my own to get into a modified half-guard.</p>
