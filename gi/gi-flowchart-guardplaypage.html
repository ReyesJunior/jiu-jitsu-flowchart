					<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph teaser-text">My Guard is all about breaking down my opponent's posture and bringing their attack to grinding halt. From my guard, I aim to control my opponent long enough to execute a successful sweep/escape (to transition into a more advantageous position), submit them (from specific positions), or generally restrict an opponent's movement to defend myself from their attacks. I seek to break down their posture by controlling their lapels, cuffs, collar, sleeves, legs, arms, and head. I will use all available tools to do so. I will use my grips, legs, hooks, and movements to help me ensure I am in the best possible position to set-up attacks, sweeps, submissions, or escapes.</p>
					<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph complete-text">I've found that relaxing and managing my resources when I am working my guard plays a more important role as the match increases in duration. Staying calm and having a good understanding of what my opponent will try to do to regain posture will help me select the best course of action when deciding wether to sweep, escape, or counter. The more I structurally deconstruct my opponent's posture, the more my opponent will focus on regaining their posture and move away from set-up an attack.</p>
					<p class="guard-play section-description-paragraph complete-text">If I can disrupt my opponent from "sewing" their attacks successfully, the I can dedicate more of my energy in controlling the space avaiable within my guard. Ultimately, my opponent will apply lots of pressure (and usually stack their weight) to pass my guard and move into a better position or keep their current attack moving forward. I alleviate the pressure they press onto me by either redirecting their efforts to assist me in a sweep or rely on leverage to create space so I can move around their strength and weight to strengthen my guard.</p>

							<p class="full-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The full guard is considered an advantageous position, since several attack options are readily available for me to use with almost no risk. Normally refered to as a "closed guard", I completely trap my opponent inside my crossed legs. With the Gi, I grip-fight to keep an opponent's grips away from my lapels, hips, or legs to prevent them from initiating a guard-pass. One of two possible senarios will happend when my opponent tries to open my full guard. They will either get their elbows inside my legs to pry my guard open or they will try to stack as much as their weight onto my neck and make me release my guard to alleviate the pressure.</p>
							<p class="full-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">To prevent the prying of my guard, I actively work to keep their posture broken and isolate one arm that I want to attack. That will force my opponent to abandon the pass and focus on protecting their arm. If my opponent decides to stand and stack, it is easier for me to isolate an arm and spin under their weight, causing them to collapse and sweep them. My higher-level training partners are effective with their grip-fighting and are good at regaining their posture, rarely giving me an arm in the process. In these cases, I find it best to "swim" around their grips and work on getting over/under hooks and modifying my guard to keep them from regaining their posture. Wearing my Gi, I prefer to set up and execute several variations of arm-bars, triangles, or chokes from my full-guard, rather than looking for a sweep.</p>

						<div class="half-guard-play slider-content-container">
							<p class="half-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The half-Guard requires me to entangle and trap one of my opponents legs to prevent them from moving into a full mount. The key to a successful half-guard is to be able to lay on my side (giving me the option to hip-escape effectively to recover a full guard or sweep) rather than laying flat on my back. I use the arm I am laying on to block an opponent's "cross-face" attempt and seek to get an underhook with my other arm. This basic framing concept will provide me with several options, depending on whether my opponent tries to flatten me out or pass my half-guard. An effective half-guard is designed to transition fluidy between either taking an opponent's back (if I can redirect their pressure) or sweep them onto their back (if I can get tip their center of mass past their base).
							<p class="half-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">From a good half guard, I seek to sweep to a better position or transition to a full-guard. The biggest factor that will dictate how to play my half-guard is the amount of pressure my opponent applies from the top position. If my opponent uses heavy pressure and is assertively attacking, I work to create space and a solid frame to repose my full guard. If my opponent is trying to pass or posture up to regroup, I close the space and secure a sweep.</p>
							<p class="half-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Here are some popular variations of the half-guard:<br>Lock-down<br>Deep half-guard<br>Z-guard<br>X-guard</p></p>

							<p class="open-guard-play scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The open guard is designed for keeping an opponent in check while transitioning between different positions, it is not a static guard. When I am transitioning between guards or defending attacks from the "open guard", I try to keep all available limbs and grips busy by keeping as many usefull points of contact on my opponent as possible. My knees, feet, elbows, and grips serve to either create a frame (to preserve a minimum amount of distance to execute efficient movement) or hook onto my opponent (to keep my opponent from creating too much space) to prevent the from moving into a superior position.</p>
							<p class="open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">In my opinion, there is a very distinguishable difference in choosing to play in "open guard" vs. being forced to play my "open guard". In the former, I purposefully open my guard to execute sweeps or attacks that will help me gain an upper hand. In the latter, my opponent is forcing me to scramble to recover my guard or prevent them from gaining any more ground during their attack. This difference becomes increasingly important when i roll with guys who are high level, as they tend to have a solid "open guard" game and often bait me to attack "openings" in their movement.</p>
							<p class="open-guard scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Here are some popular variations of the open-guard:<br>Butterfy-guard<br>De la Riva/Reverse De la Riva<br>Inverted-Guard<br>Cross-Guard<br>Grasshopper-Guard</p>
