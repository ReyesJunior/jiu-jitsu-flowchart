					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Before I can flow with my Jiu-Jitsu ground game, I need to have a solid stand-up game. All I need to do is end up in a dominant position after I take my opponent down. It's much easier said than done. I need to close the distance on my opponent and find the best way to unbalance them so I can execute my takedown. When competing in a Gi, I prefer to use Judo based takedowns (sweeps, trips, and throws) since I can use my grips. The key to a good Judo-style takedown lies in my footwork, the location of my hips (relative to my opponent's), and the placement of my hips. I cycle between controlling my opponents cuffs, lapels, collar, and head in order keep them unbalanced and occupied whlie I set-up my takedown.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph complete-text">Conversely, if my opponent does a better job at establishing grips than me, I have a couple of counter's ready to go. My first line of defense is to not let them get good grips. Assuming that I fail to prevent that, my second-line of defense is to break their grips as quickly as possible before they can set up their takedown. My last line of defense, assuming I can't break their grips, is to work around them and execute a takedown of my own before they can get a chance to.</p>
					<p class="stand-up section-description-paragraph complete-text">One thing I am weary about when grip-fighting is the possibility of my opponent "pulling guard" when I seek to take them down. In my opinion, too many BJJ practicioners skip out on the stand-up aspect of the martial art and avoid the stand-up game entirely. I try to avoid getting pulled into a guard by not letting my opponent control my posture and set-up grips on my lapels/collar. I don't want to start a match by wasting time having to break someone's guard when I could have taken them down.</p>

							<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">A solid grip fighting game is very important for Gi-based jiu-jitsu. Most takedowns, attacks, counters, sweeps, and position transitions revolve around maintaining a good base while keeping an advangageous position. Having the proper grips at the right time in the right places will tip the scales in my favor. Admittedly, it takes lots of time and lots of training to have the tools to properly navigate the clinch. In my opinion, an entire BJJ match can be determined by who "wins" the important clinch exchanges. For this reason, controlling what happens in the clinch is an essential aspect of stand-up.</p>
							<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">It is important to note that the clinch game between the Gi and No-Gi BJJ varies significantly. In the Gi, I am training to grip the jacket and push/pull on the material to manipulate my opponent. Training to properly grip and to efficiently manipulate the Gi will work different neuromusular pathways, different movement/behavioral patterns, and ultimately lead me to think about my jiu-jitsu movements differently than in No-Gi.</p>
							<p class="clinch-control scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Clinching with the Gi on will definitely put a lot of wear and tear on my hands and forearms if done incorrectly. I spend most of my grip-fighting/clinch game working to prevent my opponent from getting the upperhand. I rely more on over/underhooks to win positions and grip only when I have to. I focus a lot of my training to mobilize and "prehab" my hands, wrists, and forearms to counter the negative effects of excessive gripping/clinching when I roll.</p>

						<div class="takedown slider-content-container">
							<p class="takedown scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Before engaging in a stand-up clinch, I will keep a good low posture with a wide stance and keep my elbows tucked close to my body. The low center of gravity will force my opponent to work a little extra to get under my hips (if they want a successful hip toss), the wide stance will make it harder for my opponent to shoot for a double leg takedown (limiting them to single leg attempts, or sprawl if necessary) and the tucked elbows will kepe them from easy entry for an underhook (plus, it keeps my hands closer to defend my collar/lapels). I focus on my opponents hands and feet to block their entry where necessary.</p>
							<p class="takedown scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Once I engage in the clinch, I actively grip-fight to keep my opponent from taking the upperhand. I try and keep both of my hands busy and engaged in attacking/countering. Leg trips, hip tosses, and throws are more common in the Gi, so I work to break grips, stiff arm their movements to close the distance, and swim over/under their hooks. I protect my collar and lapels while I try to make contact with theirs. Sleeve grips are easier to counter by active "swimming" techniques.</p>
							<p class="takedown scroll-sub-section-paragraph">If I am struggling/losing a grip-fight, I keep track of my opponent's hips and footwork. I seek to prevent them from getting under my own hips or inside my stance in order to neutalize their hip tosses/throws. I will move my body to block teir set-ups and wil capitalize on the counters that I have been working on to beat them to the takedown.</p>
