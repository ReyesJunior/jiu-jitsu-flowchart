					<p class="about section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) is the combat/sport art of submission grappling that specializes in ground fighting and teaches it's practitioners to use techniques that emphasize leverage and timing to defeat an opponent. BJJ has roots stemming from Japanese jujitsu and Judo, which were originally martial arts designed to prepare Samurai warriors for hand-to-hand combat. In 1914, Japanese jujitsu and Judo made their way to Brazil and were introduced to the Gracie family. Helio Gracie, the founder of BJJ, had a frail physique and had to modify the techniques to accomodate for his physical limitations. It was this process, the blending and modification of the two martial art styles, that led Helio Gracie to create a new form of martial art, appropriately named Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.</p>
					<p class="about section-description-paragraph complete-text">Traditionally, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu requires the practitioner to wear a "Gi", a heavy cotton jacket with accompanying heavy cotton trousers. In sparring or in competition, the Gi can be used as an accessory to set-up and execute several attacks, counters, and defenses. The Gi provides a lot of friction and drag when rolling, as well as plenty of fabric to establish grips to control an opponent's movement.</p>
					<p class="about section-description-paragraph complete-text">As a practitioner of both forms of BJJ (Gi and No-Gi), there exists significant differences between the two BJJ styles. I use this site to compile, share, and document the knowledge I acquire during my quest to earn my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt. Having all this information in one centralized place will help me reflect about my game while giving me a chance to help others who are curious about BJJ. Below, I have selected the main components that I think are the keys to success for my Gi game.</p>

							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph teaser-text">Movement in Brazilian jiu-jitsu is entirely dictated by the amount of movement the hips can generate. The bottom line is that I have to control my opponent's hips <strong>while</strong> preventing my opponent from controlling my own. The Gi plays a very large role in how movement is restricted and controlled. The Gi provides me and my opponent with plenty of real estate to establish grips. I put emphasis in my grip-fighting so that I can gain the upper hand and control my opponents movement before they can have a chance to do the same.</p>
							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph complete-text">I seek to control my opponent's collar, lapels, sleeves, cuffs, and pants. These grips will help me manage and limit my opponent's hip movements (or body movement's in general) so that I can successfully set up my attacks and defenses while limiting theirs. If I can successfully manipulate my opponents movement, I can dictate the direction and pace of the match.</p>
							<p class="movement scroll-sub-section-paragraph complete-text">Another factor that I have to consider in Gi-based BJJ is the amount of friction and drag I will encounter when wearing the Gi. My bridging, shrimping, and overall fluidity of movement will be affected by the resistance and friction created between my opponent's Gi, my own Gi, and the mat. Using that logic, I maximize the amount of drag I create on my opponent and apply pressure on their hips to prevent them from moving freely. It's important to know how and when to move correctly and efficiently in order to control their posture and set myself up to execute my techniques.</p>

							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph teaser-text">As the match progresses, the Gi's belts loosen (or come off altogether), exposing the Gi's lapels. These newly exposed lapels introduce an element of risk for me and my opponent, since they can be used to set-up new attacks, counters, and defenses. With the Gi, I prefer to take out the lapels, whether it's my oppponent's or my own. I use the lapel to lock in a tight choke or wrap an opponent's arm to lock it down. When a lapel is used correctly, it will force my opponent to address the issue and expose an opening for me to attack.</p>
							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph complete-text">The Gi, and the techniques that I use, rely on proper grip placement to shut-down the movement of my opponent. Because of this, an opponent will actively work to avoid getting "trapped" in the first place and will use speed and strength to power out of a bad position. Knowing this, I let my opponent "carry my weight" and apply as much pressure on them as possible. This way, as the match progresses, my opponent will expend more energy and make more mistakes while attempting to escape and take some pressure off.</p>
							<p class="strategy scroll-sub-section-paragraph complete-text">As the match progresses, I play close attention to the amount of energy that I waste. I try to minimize my energy expenditure when I roll by avoiding getting caught in a bad position. I prefer to spend energy early on, preventing my opponent from getting good grips, than having to expend even more energy by forcing a sweep or an escape.</p>

						<div class="technique slider-content-container">
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph teaser-text">The type of techniques that I enjoy to execute when I roll require me to exercise a very large amount of control over my opponent. I use my grips to supress my opponent's ability to create space and prevent them from escaping my attacks. I use the combination of the Gi and my grip placement to "ensnare" my opponent and "trap" them in place so I methodically maneuver them into a submission.</p>
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph complete-text">The slower pace of Gi BJJ, combined with the increased control of my opponent's movement, extends the time I have to chain more complex movement patterns together. The extra time I can afford myself will depend on how much control I can exercise on my opponent. The more movement's I can "sew" together, he more attacking options I have. This will help me set "traps" for my opponents and "bait" them into making a forced movement mistake so that I can extract a submission. The ability to use grips make it more convinent for me set-up and execute highly technical, multi-step techniques.</p>
							<p class="technique scroll-sub-section-paragraph complete-text">Most, if not all, of the Gi-based techniques revolve around the central idea of blocking my oppoenent from using their hips and to compromise the structural intergity of their base. The hips are the real power-house movers in BJJ. Without them, sweeps, attacks, or high-level movement is practically impossible. In addition, i fmy opponent can't keep a good base, they are more readily swept and submitted.</p>
