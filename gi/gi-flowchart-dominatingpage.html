					<p class="dominating section-description-paragraph teaser-text">Submitting an opponent is trickier than most people think. When an opponent is trapped in a compromised position, their mindset immediately shifts to a "defend at all costs" mindset, making it very difficult to submit them. In addition to having an elevated defensive mindset, the higher the level an opponent is, the more sophisticated their defenses and escapes are supposed to be, only adding to the difficulty of extracting a submission. Fortunately for me, everyone can be submitted. I can increase my chances of extracting a submission from an opponent by increasing the amount of mistakes that they make, increasing the chances for me to attack. I can create more chances to attack my opponent the longer I can maintain a dominant position. I think the "position before submission" mindset is key when I look to finish opponents.</p>
					<p class="dominating section-description-paragraph complete-text">I use my grips to maintain control of an opponent when I am in a dominant position. These grips, along with strategic weight and pressure allocation, help me disrupt my opponent's defenses so I can keep them from escaping. I emphasize controlling their hips and not allowing them to create any space that can help them move into a better position. In addition to keeping pressure on the hips, I also use the Gi to pin them down and keep them as flat as possible when I move about the dominant position. I like to deconstruct and break down the ability that my opponent has to create a frame against my pressure my isolating their arms whenever possible.</p>
					<p class="dominating section-description-paragraph complete-text">The final finishing touches that I add to maintaining my opponent under control is to set-up "traps" and "bait" them to attempt escapes that I am prepared to counter. I dont like to pry and force a submission, but I like to trick them into opening up and giving me the space I want to improve my position instead. I find the most important detail when attacking and baiting is to keep a solid base and shut down their sweeping attempts. It's important to be able to "string" together secondary and teritary attacking options (should I miss a primary or secondary submission attempt). I need to dominate and control my opponent long enough to obtain my submission.</p>

							<p class="dominating-mount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Arguably the most dominant position in BJJ, maintaining control of the mount requires a good sense of balance. My opponent will try to bridge and do whatever they can to create enough space to recover their half-guard or sweep me onto my back (and end up in my full-guard). In order for me to avoid those problems, I have to focus on keeping a very wide (and heavy) base, prevent my opponent from pushing on my knees (to extend and trap one of my legs), and prevent my opponent from trapping an arm (to stop the trap-and-bridge sweep). I flare my knees out and tuck my feet tight under my opponent's thighs to secure my base and use my free hands to attack their collar and lapels. By bugging their neck and threatening to sink in a choke, my opponent is forced to use their hands to counter my attack, keep their hands away from pushing my knees (otherwise I will execute an easy collar/lapel choke).
							<p class="dominating-mount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">One other importnant detail about the mount is that I must be able to transition fluidly between the standard variation of the mount into a technical-mount/s-mount, should my opponent manage to turn on their side while I am on top. I must be able to "surf" my opponent's rolling maneuvers and be prepared to shift my weight around to maintain my posture and position, regardless how much they move underneath me. My hands are kept active by posting when my base is threatened or attack when my opponent makes a mistake in their escape attempts.</p>

						<div class="dominating-sidecontrol slider-content-container">
							<p class="dominating-sidecontrol scroll-sub-section-paragraph">To keep good a side-control I have to prevent my opponent from turning onto their side and keep them flat on their back. With the Gi, I take advantage of my grips and use them to control my opponent's hips and shoulders. The most important thing that I need to keep control of on my opponent, regardless of which side-control variation I use, are their hips. I have to use my hips, knees, grips, and elbows to keep their hips in check and prevent my opponent from turning into me and bringing their knees between us to recover their guard. Once I can keep them flat and unable to turn to recover their guard, I begin my attack.</p>
							<p class="dominating-sidecontrol scroll-sub-section-paragraph">My opponent will usually either use their hands and forearms to frame against my neck or seek to sneak in underhooks to create the space needed to escape. If my opponent frames, I like to use their lapel on the same side to wrap it around the framing forearm and pin it against their own body, negating their frame. If my opponent underhooks, I reach behind their neck to grip their same side lapel (taking all the slack out) and move to place my knee on their belly, preventing them from effectively turning into me. In both situations, my opponent cannot recover their guard and allows me to continue my attacks as I maintain a stable side-control.</p>

						<div class="dominating-north-south slider-content-container">
							<p class="dominating-north-south scroll-sub-section-paragraph">I prefer moving into the north-south position when I transition from one side-control to another. The advantage of the norht-south position is that I can keep control on my oponent and expose an arm or attack for a choke while I transition. I keep the north-south position by gripping and controlling my opponent's hips while using a shoulder to drive my body weight down onto their belly. The combination of the shoulder pressure and hip control will minimize the effects of my opponent's bridging attempts when they try to escape. I have to make sure that I am on my toes and off my knees so that my opponent can't effectively grab onto one of my legs and disrupt my movement. This tripod position gives me great control and will usually force my opponent to try and turn into one side, exposing an arm for me to attack, giving me the option to take their back, or secure a modified collar/lapel choke (if I had begun to set one up earlier).</p>
							<p class="dominating-north-south scroll-sub-section-paragraph">If I am unable to tripod and tip-toe the north-south position, I can also get it through my knees. The difference is that I would go chest to chest and my clamp my elbows tight to their body, tucked underneath their armpits to prevent them from turning and escaping. I would still hold on to their hips and sprawl out, using my own hips to drive their heads flat onto one side. This will force my opponent to alleviate some of the pressure and make them use their arms to frame against my hips, giving me a chance to attack them.</p>
							<p class="dominating-north-south scroll-sub-section-paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, I like to slip into the north-south position only during transition (I don't like to stay there very long). In either case, whether I stand and tripod or sprawl, most my opponent's try to bring their knees under my armpits to try and roll me over them. If I can't force them to make a mistake or create an entry point that I can attack, I move on to another position.</p>

<!-- Dominate backmount -->

						<div class="dominating-backmount slider-content-container">
							<p class="dominating-backmount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">Keeping control of the back-mount depends on a couple important details. The first thing I have to ensure is the effectiveness of my leg hooks, since they are what will help me prevent my opponent from moving freely. I have to ensure active leg movement to be able to counter my opponent's tendency to roll onto their knees and "turtle up" and counter their ability to use their hips and legs to move effectively. My legs hooks will ensure that I keep my opponent stetched out and unable to escape as I look to sink in a submission. Whenever possible, I prefer to time my oponent's roll and lock in a body triangle. It's important to note that my opponent can attack and counter/submit me when I lock in my body triangle, but those options will require my opponent to use their hands and expose their neck ang giving up a choke (so I think the risk is worth the reward).</p>
							<p class="dominating-backmount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The second detail that will help me keep a back-mount is preventing my opponent from turning into me. To stop my opponent from turning into me, I can't allow my opponent to undo a leg hook (this will allow their hips to move freely) and create the necessary amount of space required to be able to turn. All my opponent would have to do is undo a leg hook, pin that leg down under their hips, and hip turn to face me (completing their back-mount escape).</p>
							<p class="dominating-backmount scroll-sub-section-paragraph">The final detail that will help me keep an opponent's back is how effectively I attcking my opponent's neck. I grip-fight to control my opponents collar and lapels with the intention of securing a choke. I ensure to keep my opponent busy by grip-fighting and try to stop them from effectively defending their neck. If I can keep their focus on defending their neck, they will be unable to use their hands for anything else. These 3 details work together to afford me control in the back-mount, as I look for a submission.</p>
